      The electric locomotive has two head and two intermediate booster sections
      and is used to haul super-heavy long freight trains on flat terrain or
      heavy trains in mountainous terrain on sections with a complex profile.
      The use of two booster sections instead of two head sections improves the
      working conditions of the locomotive crew due to the ability to pass
      through all sections during movement and reduces the overall cost of the
      locomotives due to the absence of unnecessary cabins.

      The locomotive is known for its simplicity in operating - in the cab,
      original versions have a dashboard with a panel for gauges and switches, a
      throttle/dynamic brake wheel and brake levers, along with a knob for the
      horn, which has low/high and soft/hard tones and Hasler Bern speedometers.

      The SZD Class AA20 was a one-off experimental 4-14-4 steam locomotive
      constructed by the Soviet Union by Krupp and the Voroshilovgrad Locomotive
      Factory in 1934 for the Sovetskie Zheleznye Dorogi. The AA steam
      locomotive was the first and only locomotive in the world history with
      seven driving axles in one rigid frame. The steam locomotive's boiler was
      one of the largest locomotive boilers in Europe. Due to the sheer size of
      the locomotive, a number of measures were taken to improve the curve fit
      of the locomotive.
